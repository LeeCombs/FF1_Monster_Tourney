.csv -> .json {
	The Monster, Spells, and Skills .json files are created by converting 
	their .csv counterparts through http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm
	
	If using that site, ensure these options are selected:
	-	First row is column names
	-	Input CSV Quoting Character is Apostrophe
	-	Consider value of NULL in CSV to be null in JSON
	-	Do Not output field/value pair if value is empty
	-	Recreate nest objects and arrays (Headings use /)
	
	The types, spells, skills, etc. arrays are in the format of '[0, 1, 2]' and
	are to be converted into appropriate arrays upon loading the data

Relevant Bugs {
	-- General --
	- Target-dark should not be applied when the target is asleep/stopped
	- Hit% should be applied even if asleep, and not clamped until after evade is subtracted
	- Status attacks are attempted on missed after the first successful hit
	- Enemies always wake from sleep
	- Resist Element, all-target spells (e.g. AFIR) don't hit the caster
	- Poison doesn't work on enemies
	- Absorb for enemy targets misloaded for magic, making FOG not work
	- For enemy targets, Hit% is not loaded/saved for use by magic
	- Enemy elemental resistances not stored, spells like AFIR and XFER don't work
	
	-- Monsters --
	- 44 ZOMBIE, Earth resistance likely unintentional as it's inconsistent
	- 64 R.GOYLE, Only enemy with attack element but no status attack
	- 81 WzMUMMY, Has Sleep status attack, but Psn/Stn element instead of Status
	- 105 SORCERER, Only enemy with status attack but no element
	
	-- Skills/Spells -- 
	- HEL2 effectivity should be 0x18 (24), instead of 48
	- LOK2 should use effect 0E (Evasion Down) instead of 10 (Evasion Up)
	- LOCK's effect 0E (Evasion Down) always misses
	- TMPR should probably use 0B (Attack Up) instead of 0D (Attack/Accuracy Up)
	- SABR should have a spell accuracy value, which is unknown
	
	-- Status Attacks --
	- If the TARGET is resistant to an enemy's weakness, base chance = 0
	-- Should be resistant to enemy's elemental attack
