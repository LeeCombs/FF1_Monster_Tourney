.csv -> .json {
	The Monster, Spells, and Skills .json files are created by converting 
	their .csv counterparts through http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm
	
	If using that site, ensure these options are selected:
		First row is column names
		Input CSV Quoting Character is Apostrophe
		Consider value of NULL in CSV to be null in JSON
		Do Not output field/value pair if value is empty
		Recreate nest objects and arrays (Headings use /)
	
	The types, spells, skills, etc. arrays are in the format of '[0, 1, 2]' and
	are to be converted into appropriate arrays upon loading the data 
}

TODO: Just convert the json data strings of the arrays (spells, skills, etc) into the actual array itself using something else ffs
No more of this converting on the fly, just have the input data valid from the start.............................
